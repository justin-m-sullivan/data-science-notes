##Mac & Terminal Setup Notes
# Command + Spacebar = Spotlight search
# Command + C = terminates a process on command line
# Adding a "." @ beginning of a file/directory makes that file hidden

##Git
# Git diff = shows what is different / has been updated
# git remote -v = shows all remotes for that repo
